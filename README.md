# Sanguinize

OOP Arcade arena hack and slash

Uses Processing, requires GIFAnimation libraries 

You rely on blood to live!! Use it for moves and feeding your weapon!
The more blood you collect, the higher your final score!

Play as Sal, a stranded vampire who needs to send some blood back to the family to redeem himself
Fight growing waves of enemies to feed their unending hunger

Enemies: After killing enemies, your blood bar increaes. If they attack you, your blood bar decreases
 Mosquitoes: They fly around and deal damage until you kill them
 Farmer: They are on ground enemies that chase you around and deal damage 

Special Attacks:
 Slow Motion Attack that allows you to jump really high after you hit an enemy and slows down the surroundings
